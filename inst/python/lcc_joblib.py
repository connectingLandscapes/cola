"""
Created on Tue Oct 10 16:47:57 2023
Script to calculate pairwise cost distance corridors using Networkit.
If the memory threshold is set low enough, the script calculates
distances from source points to every cell in the map in batches
and writes to an hdf file on disk. It then reads distances from
the hdf file and calculates cost distance corridors in parallel
using joblib. Best performance will be with a solid state drive.
